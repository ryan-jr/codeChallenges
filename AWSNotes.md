#  AWS Certified Developer Associate Notes

- On demand servers that can scale easily

- AWS Servers are broken up into regions, regions are generally a cluster of data center

- To select an appropriate AWS region you may want to select based on compliance(e.g. legal requirements/data governance), proximity/latency, service availablity, and pricing.  

- AWS Availability Zones: AZ's are one or more discrete data centers w/ redundant pwr, networking, and conn to isolate from disasters/issues but are linked/fast networked

### IAM Users/Groups

- Global Service

- IAM = Identity/Access mgmt

- Root acct created by default, Users are ppl w/in the org and can be grouped (by role/job etc...)

- Groups can only contain users, not other groups.  Users can belong to multiple groups or no group at all

- IAM has various permissons via JSON documents called policies and services should be provided the principle of least priv

- IAM console/dashboard allows you to create users, the credential type (pass/autogenerated), set groups/permissions(policies JSON), tags.

- CSVs that can be downloaded contain the autogenerated password

- The console will show policy inheritance, and allow you to create an account alias with a specific URL

### IAM Policies

- Group level: Applies to everyone

- Inline policy: Only applies to a user

- Policies can apply to multiple people/people can belong to multiple groups (e.g. a developer group and an audit group)

IAM Policy strucucture: Version (always has YYYY-MM-DD), ID: Identifies the policy, Statement: One or more individual statements (required)

IAM Policy Statements: SID: Identifier for the statement (optional), Effect: Allows/Denies Access (Allow, Deny), Principal:The account/user/role the policy will apply to, Action: List of actions the policy allows/denies, Resource: List of reosurces to which the actions are applied to Condition: Conditions for when the policy is in effect (optional)

### IAM/MFA Overview

- In AWS you can set up password policies including length character type etc... and reset length and prevent password re-use

- You can require MFA, Root accts can have MFA MFA = password you know + device you own (token, phone, etc...)

- MFA options: Virtual MFA device (google authenticator, Authy, etc..), UTF key (YubiKey), Hardware Keyufob, or SurePassID Keyfob

### AWS Access Keys, CLI, SDK

- AWS Mangagement console

- CLI

- SDK

- Access keys for CLI/SDK are generated via the AWS Console 

### IAM Roles for AWS Services

- Some AWS Service will need to perform actions on the users behalf, and will need permissions (e.g. an EC2 instance/virtual server) the EC2 instance would need an IAM role to access AWS

- Common roles: EC2 Instance, Lambda function roles, CloudFormation roles, etc...


### IAM Security tools

- Creds report (lists all users accts users and status of their creds, acct level)

- IAM access advisor (user level)

- IAM user reports can show when passwords were last used, enabled, when keys were last rolled, etc...

### IAM Best Practices

- Don't use Root except for setup

- One physical user = one AWS user

- Assign users to groups and assign permissions to groups

- Create strong password policy/MFA

- Create and use roles for AWS services

- Use access keys for programatic access

- Use reports to audit credentials/access

- Don't share access keys etc...


### IAM Summary

- Users: Mapped to physical users, has password for AWS console

- Groups: Contains users only

- Policies: JSON doc that outlines permissions for users/groups

- Roles: for AWS services

- Security: MFA/Password Policy

- Acces Keys: access AWS using CLI/SDK

- Audit: IAM Creds reports and IAM access advisor


### Things to study with IAM

- IAM Security Tools

- IAM Users/Groups

- IAM Policy/JSON context
